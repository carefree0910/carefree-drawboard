# Contributing

Contributions are truly welcomed! Here are some good (common) ways to get started:

* **GitHub Discussions**: Currently the best way to chat around.
* **GitHub Issues**: Bugs! Fixes! PRs!.

Apart from these:
* It might be the best to start from the [Contributing](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-drawboard-doc/docs/contributing-guides/contributing) Wiki page.
* If you are truly an enthusiast, you may check out our [Roadmap](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-drawboard-doc/docs/about/roadmap), pick up what you are interested, and create the corresponding PR!

## Style Guide

If you are still interested: `carefree-drawboard` ðŸŽ¨ adopted [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) and [`mypy`](https://github.com/python/mypy) to stylize its codes, so you may need to check the format, coding style and type hint with them before your codes could actually be merged.
